## Working in the Cloud (Gitpod IDE)

You can also execute the exercises from the browser in the cloud,
if you cannot or do not want to install Git and the exercises locally.

**Prerequisite**: If you have an account with [*GitHub*](https://github.com), [*GitLab*](https://gitlab.com) or [*BitBucket*](https://bitbucket.com) (or set one up), you can also work in the cloud (on [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io)).

[**Open Git Workshop on Gitpod**](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/bstachmann/git-workshop)

After opening, you may need to log in and grant access rights for the Gitpod app.
