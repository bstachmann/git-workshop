### Download exercises

Open the [Git-Bash](/installation/kommandozeile).
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the exercises.

**Tip**: Work on a **local drive** if possible. There are sometimes performance problems on network drives.

Note: The download and unpacking can of course also be done with the *File Explorer* instead of the Git-Bash.

The exercise can be unpacked from a zip archive. You can get this at

[Download git-uebungen.zip](https://github.com/bstachmann/git-workshop/releases/latest/download/git-uebungen.zip) 

or it will be provided through the seminar organization. Save `git-uebungen.zip`.

    $ cd <where-you-saved-the-zip>
    $ unzip git-uebungen.zip
    $ cd git-uebungen/aufgaben/intro-hallo-welt/
