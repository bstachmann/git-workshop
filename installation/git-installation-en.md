### Installing Git

First of all, we need Git. [Install it](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or have it installed (if your computer is managed by others). If you install on Windows, the installer will offer you multiple options several times. Just take the preselected options if you don't have any special requirements for the installation.

### Verify installation, open Git-Bash

**MacOs**, **Linux**: Open a terminal session.

**Windows**: Open Git-Bash. To do this, briefly press the Windows key and then type Git-Bash (or click on the icon that the installer left behind). Then a Git-Bash terminal should open. Info: We run the (command line) examples for this workshop with Bash because this works well on Windows as well as Linux and MacOs. Experienced users can of course use their favorite shell, e.g. zsh or powershell.

Enter the following:

    $ git version
    git version 2.35.1

If Git outputs a different version number for you, no problem: The main thing is that Git is there.
