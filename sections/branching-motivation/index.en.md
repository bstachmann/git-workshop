#### Ring ... Rrring ... Rrrrring

*(Team Lead)*: Hello?

*(Boss)*: This bug with the encoding. It needs to be fixed.

*(Team Lead)*: How about saying "Hello" first?

*(Boss)*: By 3 PM tomorrow, at the latest!

*(Team Lead)*: Uh, that's going to be a bit tricky, we've already started developing for the next release...

*(Boss)*: One more thing: The recording feature must not be in the release. Privacy concerns, you know.

*(Boss hangs up)*
