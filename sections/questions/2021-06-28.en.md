## A Few Questions

---

A topic that I always find challenging is **Resolve Conflict**. We have defined that we only allow FastForward merges. Thus, the **feature branch** must be kept up-to-date (relative to the develop branch). It can always happen that you encounter a **conflict**. This is the case when several people work in parallel. What is the cleanest way to resolve this? I now know several tricks... but what does the professional do? üòâ

- Strategies regarding **Forks**, changes between forks only in one direction?
