### The Developers of Git

 * Junio C. Hamano
 * Shawn O. Pearce
 * Linus Torvalds
 * and others.

The Linux kernel was versioned manually for a long time (Tarballs & Patches).

Later, a commercial version control system called Bitkeeper was used.
Due to licensing reasons, an alternative was sought starting in 2005.

> There is no way to do CVS right.

(Linus Torvalds, May 2007)

### Challenges of the Kernel Community

 * Many very independent developers
 * Parallel development
 * Small patches and large features
 * Proof of code origin


---

In 2005, for version control, there were

 * successful commercial products
 * established open-source solutions

 often with great UIs and more features.

## So, why Git?

What was the "killer feature"?

---


The **Pull Request**
makes it easier to create changes decentrally and
later offer them to others for integration.

*Irony: The killer feature of Git is not even a feature of Git:*

Git hosts like **GitHub** (and *GitLab*, *BitBucket*, ...) offered this as web applications and made it popular.

**Git facilitates open-source contributions!**


---


  * Robust and simple branching and merging
  * Performs well, even with a lot of source code
  * Very flexible workflow
  * Exchange between repositories (Forking/Decentralization)
  * Open-source
  * Quasi-standard  
  * and more...
