In 2005, for version control, there were

 * successful commercial products
 * established open-source solutions

 often with great UIs and more features.

## So, why Git?

What was the "killer feature"?

The **Pull Request**
makes it easier to create changes decentrally and
later offer them to others for integration.

*Irony: The killer feature of Git is not even a feature of Git:*

Git hosts like **GitHub** (and *GitLab*, *BitBucket*, ...) offered this as web applications and made it popular.

**Git facilitates open-source contributions!**
