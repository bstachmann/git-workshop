## Tips

 * `git clone <original> <copy>`: Clones a repository.
 * `git remote -v`: Shows which other clones are known,
   especially `origin`.

A Git repository named `myfirstrepo` has already been created.
It contains two commits.

### Directories

 * `./` Main directory for this exercise
   - `myfirstrepo/` Existing repository.
  

<h2>Step 0 - START <!-- UEB/Cloning Repositories/0 --></h2>

<h2>Step 1 - Perform clone <!-- UEB/Cloning Repositories/1 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

Create a clone of `myfirstrepo` named `myfirstclone`.

<h2>Step 2 - Examine clone <!-- UEB/Cloning Repositories/2 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

Look at the commits and
show the origin of the clone `myfirstclone`.
`origin` usually stands for the repository
from which it was cloned.
Then show the status.

<h2>Step 3 - Work in the clone <!-- UEB/Cloning Repositories/3 --></h2>
