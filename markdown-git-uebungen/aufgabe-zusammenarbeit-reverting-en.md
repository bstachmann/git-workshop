# Exercise - Reverting

Git allows changes
made in an earlier commit
to be undone by a new commit.

## Info

* `git revert <commit>` creates a new commit,
  which undoes the changes of an earlier commit.

* With a merge commit
  you must also specify to which merge parent
  the determination of the changes should refer:<br/>
  `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit>` 

* With commits further back, conflicts can occur
  (because affected files were further edited in later commits).
  These must then be resolved like merge conflicts.

## Example setup

In the example repository, a file was renamed,
the corresponding commit is tagged with `umbenennung`.

In addition, a feature branch was integrated via merge.
The merge commit is tagged with `feature-merge`.

Both changes are to be undone.

<h2>Step 0 - START <!-- UEB/Reverting/0 --></h2>


<pre><code>$ <b>cd repo</b><br><br><br></code></pre>


<h2>Step 1 - Undo a single commit. <!-- UEB/Reverting/1 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

In the history, the file `README.md` was renamed to `liesmich`.
Undo this change.
Tip: The commit is tagged as `umbenennung`.

<h2>Step 2 - Undo merge commit. <!-- UEB/Reverting/2 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

In the history, a feature branch was integrated via merge.file . Undo this change.
Tip: The merge commit is tagged as `feature-merge`.
Tip: The success can be recognized by the disappearance of the file `from-feature`.

<h2>Step 3 - Feature branch broken!? <!-- UEB/Reverting/3 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

A revert is often used to temporarily roll back a feature,
e.g. due to a production problem.
Later you want to correct the feature branch and then integrate it again.
This is not so easy.

In the example, the `feature` branch has undergone further development.
Try to merge it again.
Examine the error message and the commit graph.
Tip: The failed merge can be aborted with `git merge --abort`.

<h2>Step 4 - Undo merge revert again. <!-- UEB/Reverting/4 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

The trick is to revert the revert commit itself,
then those changes are back
on which the further development of the feature is based.

Tip: The commit is tagged as `feature-merge`.
