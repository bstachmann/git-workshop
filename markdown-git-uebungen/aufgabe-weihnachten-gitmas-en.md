# Exercise - Merry Christmas!

Git can also be a Christmas tool.

This is about creating a Git graph that looks like a
Christmas tree by branching and merging.

Let your creativity run wild, or follow these **tips:**

 * Branch a series of branches from ˋmainˋ
 * Make a commit on each of the branches so there is something to merge.
 * Go to the second branch and merge the first. Then go to the third...
 * Then merge the last branch to ˋmainˋ.
 * If you can script, e.g. with Bash or Python: ˋforˋ loops are useful.


<h2>Step 0 - START <!-- UEB/Merry Christmas!/0 --></h2>

<h2>Step 1 - And now a Christmas tree <!-- UEB/Merry Christmas!/1 --></h2>

Start in directory `git-uebungen/aufgaben/<unknown>`.

Branch and merge so that ˋgit log --graph --onelineˋ
outputs a Christmas tree.
